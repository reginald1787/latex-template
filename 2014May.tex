\header{Project Experience}


\employer{Aldebaran Robotics - AI Lab }{2014}{R\&D intern}{}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Introduced causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical models for robot learning and planning.
	\item Extracted keypoints based on fast SIFT algorithm and Harris corner detection from logpolar images.
	\item Improved object recognition by motivating the robot actively saccading the keypoints. 
	\item Designed and developed the robot's motor commands allowing interaction with the robot's surrounding environment.
	\item Integrated with deep learning to deal with information flows.
	\end{achievements}

\employer{Google Paris Hash Code}{2014}{"Xcoder" team leader}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Used divide-and-conquer methods to split into small computational geometry problems, and then used the Melkman algorithm to find the convex hull of each small patch. Achieved nearly O(n) complexity for 716*1522 points.
	\item Firstly used a stochastic algorithm to obtain initial results, based on the result, optimized our algorithm by greedy strategy.
	\end{achievements}

\employer{Kaggle Data Competition}{2014}{Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Data reduction: removed irrelevant entries reduce raw data from 20GB into 2GB.
	\item Behavior modeling: analyzed the key factors of a purchase action from both customers' perspectives and items' characteristics.
	\item Feature engineering: transformed raw feature information (categories, names, dates, etc.) into meaningful numerical values.
	\item Classification: used regression, SVM, random forests, naive Bayes and neural networks as classifiers.
	\item Evaluation: took the scores as feedback, restarted modeling and feature selection and adjusted parameters of classification algorithms.
	\end{achievements}

\employer{PayPal - Advanced Risk Sciences}{2013}{Statistical analyst intern}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Built unusual-pattern detecting model for fraud-transactions based on multi-regression. 
	\item Assembled a multi-threading computing framework for large scale data analyzing. 
	\item Designed automatical analyzing process including pulling raw data from Teradata warehouse, analyzing data through distributed computing framework and presenting/visualizing the results. 
	\item Also used principle component analysis (PCA) and local linear embedding (LLE) for feature reduction.
	\end{achievements}

\employer{Microsoft Research Asia - Data Management, Analytics, and Services}{2013}{Research intern}
	\begin{achievements}
	\item Improved online ads displaying and recommender system for advertisers based on collaborative-filtering algorithm and webpage content mining. 
	\item Used unsupervised clustering for MSN visitors' profile mining and built behavior pattern model for typical clusters. 
	\item Analyzed telephone records of hotel reservations by NLP tools to develop recommender system for operators. Also tried to incorporate sentiment analysis to automatically rate operators' services quality. 
	\item Designed and developed interface and animation of a \textsf{Bing} desktop application for personalized searching.
	\end{achievements}
