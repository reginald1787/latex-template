\section{Experience}
\cventry{2014}{Aldebaran Robotics}{R\&D intern}{AI Lab}{}{
To make robots reacting more intelligent, I introduced causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic graphical models for robot learning and planning. I also worked on designing the robot's motor commands allowing interaction with the robot's surrounding environment. Specifically, the robot can recognize an object by actively saccading the keypoints of logpolar images. 
\newline
- Knowledge involved: graphical models, Bayesian networks, causality, Harris corner detection, SIFT algorithm, information entropy.
\newline
- Technology used: C++, Python(numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn), OpenCV, Nao robot platform, Linux shell programming.

There were two problems in the competition. For 1st problem: we used a divide-and-conquer method to split into small computational geometry problems, and then used Graham-scan algorithm to find the convex hull. For the 2nd problem: we firstly used a stochastic algorithm to obtain initial results, then we optimized it by greedy algorithm. We also added some constraints to avoid local minima.
\newline
- Technology used: Python, stochastic algorithm, Graham-scan algorithm.

\cventry{2014}{Kaggle Data Competition}{Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge}{}{}{
The goal of this challenge is trying to predict customers' future behaviors given the past transactions history. I have done following works for the competition:\\
1) data reduction: removing irrelevant entries reduce raw data from 20GB into 2GB.\\
2) behavior modeling: analyze the key factors of a purchase action from both customers' perspectives and items' characteristics.\\
3) feature engineering: transform raw feature information (categories, names, dates, etc.) into meaningful numerical values.\\
4) classification: used regression, SVM, random forests, naive Bayes and neural networks for classifiers.\\
5) evaluation: took the scores as feedback, restarted modeling and feature selection and adjusted parameters of classification algorithms.
\newline
- Knowledge involved: supervised clustering (SVM, regression, random forests, naive Bayes, neural networks), data mining and engineering
\newline 
- Technology used: Python(numpy, scikit-learn, pandas), Liblinear, LibSVM, C++

\cventry{2013}{Microsoft Research Asia}{Research intern}{Data Management, Analytics, and Services}{}{
During the 9 months internship in Microsoft Research Asia, I mainly participated in 4 projects: \\
1) online ads displaying and recommendation for advertisers. \\
2) mining MSN visitors and modeling their behaviors \\
3) mining telephone records of hotel reservation to develop recommender system for operators. \\
4) developing a Win 8 desktop application for personalized searching.\\
% \newline -- online ads displaying and recommendation for advertisers: we basically used collaborative-filtering algorithm and used sparse SVD to achieve real-time efficiency. Also we incorporated content information into topic models to improve recommendation.
% \newline -- mining MSN visitors and modeling their behaviors: firstly used un-supervised clustering methods for user profile-mining. For typical cluster, built predictive model based on patterns and correlations.
% \newline -- mining telephone records of hotel reservation to develop recommender system for operators: we used natual language processing (NLP) tool to analyze the needs and requirements of customers. We also used sentiment analysis to determine the customer's satisfactory. 
% \newline -- developing a Win 8 desktop application for personalized searching: the "Growing Searches" idea originated in Microsoft Research Cambridge, and we implemented the concepts with Bing team. I was in charge of interface design and animation. In particular, I designed and developed the "growing" animation of the "searching tree". 
All the works were dealing large-scale ($\sim 10$ TB) and multi-form (txt,wav,json,html,csv) datasets. And they were all done in Microsoft "COSMOS" distribution computing platform.
\newline
- Knowledge involved: recommendation algorithms, topic model, profile mining, clustering, predictive model, NLP, sentiment analysis, searching.
\newline
- Technology used: MySQL, C\#, .NET, distribution system/COSMOS, NLP tool, SVD, WPF.
